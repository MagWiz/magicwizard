## Introduction

Magic Wizard is a simply 2D platform game. Most game mechanis have been implemented, however it lacks dedicated graphics, audio and levels (although simply level editor is provided). I have started this project to learn some C++ game programming, thus many things would be coded in another way if I would have to rewrite everything.

## Requirements

* Linux, OSX, Windows (although builds on OSX and Windows are not straight forward, yet)
* Simple and Fast Multimedia Library [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) 

## Installation

Assuming that you have deb based distribution (Debian, Ubuntu among others):
```sh
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
git https://github.com/MagWiz/magicwizard.git
cd magicwizard
make 
./mw
```
## Binaries

There are some development builds, you can find them here: https://magwiz.net/builds/
